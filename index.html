									<h2>About Me</h2>

									<p>I am Ph.D. candidate in linguistics at USC. 
										My major interest lies in the place of phonology in grammar and its interaction with other grammatical components, 
										especially morphology. Currently, my dissertation research is about reduplication, 
										which features newly-reported data collected with techniques such as corpus construction and acoustic recording.</p>
										
									<p>Besides formal phonology and morphology, 
										I have also worked on articulatory phonology, phonetics, especially for understudied languages. 
										My experience of investigating understudied languages is introduced <a href="/2Fieldwork">here</a>.</p>

									<p>I am a member of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/uscphongroup/home">USC Phonetics and Phonology Group</a> and <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/shlac/">Language and Computation Lab (ShLAC)</a>.</p>
