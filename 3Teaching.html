						<p><i>Language and Society</i> is a course that looks into how language and society interact with and influence each other.
							Below is one of my favorate quotes that I always shared with students during the first meeting:  </p>

						<blockquote>
							... the development of language must be counted as by far
							the most important evolutionary development in the human species.
							And once manâ€™s survival and preeminence had been assured through language,
							it was language that made possible our living in larger stable and more viable communities,
							followed ultimately by the emergence of language-based intellectual,
							moral and legal systems of rational thought, literature, song, and drama,
							such as are the glories of civilized life.(R.H. Robins,
							<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/General_Linguistics/cr6OAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0">General Linguistics, 4th edition</a>,
							p.17)
