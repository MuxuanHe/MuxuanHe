		<p><i>Language and Society</i> is a course that looks into how language and society interact with and influence each other.
			Below is one of my favorate quotes that I always shared with students during the first meeting:  </p>

		<blockquote>
			... the development of language must be counted as by far
			the most important evolutionary development in the human species.
			And once man’s survival and preeminence had been assured through language,
			it was language that made possible our living in larger stable and more viable communities,
			followed ultimately by the emergence of language-based intellectual,
			moral and legal systems of rational thought, literature, song, and drama,
			such as are the glories of civilized life.(R.H. Robins,
			<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/General_Linguistics/cr6OAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0">General Linguistics, 4th edition</a>,
			p.17)
